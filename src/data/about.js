		copy: `<p>a Frontend Developer. I have been living in London since 2012 and have over 7 years of experience 
        building websites and web applications. In those years I've worked with a huge range of projects across 
        different platforms and technologies in multiple sectors.</p> 
            <p>My main area of work at the moment involves building React web applications and I have been 
            commercially working with React since September 2020.</p>  
            <p>Previously I worked in a digital agency for over 6 years and worked on a variety of websites 
            from ecommerce to legal and hospitality. And through those years I mostly worked with HTML, CSS3 
            and JS, as well as a wide range of CMSs.</p> 
            <p>I really enjoy working with animations including GSAP, CSS3 animations and WebGL technologies. </p> 
            <p>I’m always trying to be on top of the latest technology and constantly improve my skills. 
            The rapid change of the technology and my growing curiosity keep me going and loving what I do.</p>`,
